                <h2><a href="https://www.wallabag.org/blog/2016/01/08/wallabag-alpha1-v2">wallabag 2.0.0-alpha.1 available</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>We released our first alpha 4 months ago, and we were on late to release this new one. Sorry for that (but we worked very hard to give you new great features).</p>
<h2>wallabag 2.0.0-alpha.1</h2>
<p>Features list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public registration</li>
<li>migration from wallabag v1 (based on JSON export)</li>
<li>migration from Pocket (it works, but we need to implement asynchronous import: if you have too many articles, it can fail). Documentation still in progress (you'll have a great documentation in next days)</li>
<li>exports in many formats (PDF, JSON, EPUB, MOBI, XML, CSV).</li>
<li>2-Factor authentication (via email)</li>
<li>Tagging rule: create a rule to automatically assign tags to entries!</li>
<li>German / French and English translations</li>
<li>some minor fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Already implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>a REST API (<a href="http://v2.wallabag.org/api/doc">you can have a look to the documentation</a>)</li>
<li>authorization via oAuth2</li>
<li>a new default theme, called <code>material</code></li>
<li>save an article, read it, favorite it, archive it. (Hopefully)</li>
<li>assign tags to entries</li>
<li>edit article titles</li>
<li>RSS feeds (with ability to limit number of articles)</li>
<li>create a new account from the config page</li>
<li>filter entries by reading time, domain name, creation date, status, etc.</li>
<li>recover passwords from login page (you have to fill your email on config page)</li>
<li>picture preview, if available, is displayed for each entry</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<h2>Testing wallabag 2.0.0-alpha.1</h2>
<p>We encourage you to try out the new wallabag v2 alpha on our demo website: <a href="http://v2.wallabag.org">http://v2.wallabag.org</a> (login wallabag, password wallabag). You can also create a new account on this website, but don't remember that we can drop our database at any time: <strong>this website is not a production one!</strong></p>
<p>There are definitely bugs, so please tell us if you find one of them (have a look <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues">at the existing issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/new">create a new one</a> if necessary).</p>
<h2>Installing wallabag 2.0.0-alpha.1</h2>
<p>Please don't use in production! This is an <strong>unstable</strong> branch, expect many things to be broken.</p>
<p>wallabag v2 uses <a href="http://symfony.com">Symfony2 framework</a>.</p>
<p>The only way to install wallabag v2 properly at the moment is to use Composer. To download wallabag, <a href="{filename}pages/download.md">you can click here</a> or clone the project via git:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag.git -b v2
cd wallabag
composer install
php app/console wallabag:install
php app/console server:run
</pre></div>


<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>We can say that next step will be the first beta of wallabag v2. When? In 2016 :-) !</p>
                </div>
            </article>
            <hr/>
            <article>
                <h2><a href="https://www.wallabag.org/blog/2015/10/06/developers-oauth2">Developers, connect your app to wallabag via oAuth2</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>We finally implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">oAuth2</a> in wallabag v2.</p>
<p>This blog post is here to explain to you how you can integrate your application to wallabag v2.</p>
<p>For each call to our API, you need a token. If you do a call without token, you will have this message: <code>OAuth2 authentication required</code>.</p>
<p>For example, try this command:</p>
<p><em>NOTE: the following commands make use of <a href="https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie">the HTTPie library</a>. Make sure it is installed on your system before using it.</em></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http GET http://v2.wallabag.org/api/entries/1.json
</pre></div>


<p>To create a token for a given user, you need a client id and a client secret. As we are still in alpha, we create a client for you (but in few weeks, each application will have its own client id and client secret).</p>
<p>For the existing user nicosomb/nicolas, you can do this call:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http POST http://v2.wallabag.org/oauth/v2/token \
    grant_type=password \
    client_id=1_3bcbxd9e24g0gk4swg0kwgcwg4o8k8g4g888kwc44gcc0gwwk4 \
    client_secret=4ok2x70rlfokc8g0wws8c8kwcokw80k44sg48goc0ok4w0so0k \
    username=nicosomb \
    password=nicolas
</pre></div>


<p>The API will return a response like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-store, private
Connection: close
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Tue, 06 Oct 2015 18:24:03 GMT
Host: localhost:8000
Pragma: no-cache
X-Debug-Token: be00a1
X-Debug-Token-Link: /profiler/be00a1
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.9-1ubuntu4.13
{
    &quot;access_token&quot;: &quot;ZWFjNjA3ZWMwYWVmYzRkYTBlMmQ3NTllYmVhOGJiZDE0ZTg1NjE4MjczOTVlNzM0ZTRlMWQ0MmRlMmYwNTk5Mw&quot;,
    &quot;expires_in&quot;: 3600,
    &quot;refresh_token&quot;: &quot;ODBjODU1NWUwNmUzZTBkNDQ5YWVlZTVlMjQ2Y2I0OWM2NTM1ZGM2M2Y3MDhjMTViM2U2MzYxYzRkMDk5ODRlZg&quot;,
    &quot;scope&quot;: null,
    &quot;token_type&quot;: &quot;bearer&quot;
}
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>access_token</code> is useful to do a call to the API endpoint. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http GET http://v2.wallabag.org/api/entries.json \
    &quot;Authorization:Bearer Yzk1MDk1YmE3NjE0OTMwMTgxODc5ODdlODMwNDIxYzlhOWMxNzY3N2Q0ZjZjMjFkNTRjYzAxMjgxZTlmNmJmNg&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>This call will return all the entries for <code>nicosomb</code>.</p>
<p>You can create your own user on <a href="http://v2.wallabag.org">http://v2.wallabag.org</a> for your tests.</p>
<p>If you want to see all the API endpoints, you can have a look to our API documentation: <a href="http://v2.wallabag.org/api/doc">http://v2.wallabag.org/api/doc</a>.<br />
We will have more endpoints in few weeks if necessary.</p>
<p>If you have some problems with the API, <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/new">feel free to create a new issue on GitHub</a>.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p><strong>wallabag is an open source read-it-later application</strong>.</p>
<p>We started developing wallabag in 2013 using PHP classes but quickly ran into many limitations: no API, database fields missing, etc.). So, we decided to re-write it from scratch, this time using a framework. After many stalled attempts, we're proud to say that v2 is almost here!</p>
<p>In 2014, Jérémy Benoist (<a href="https://github.com/j0k3r">aka @j0k3r</a>) joined us. He is an awesome Symfony lead developer! With his help, we were finally able to ramp up production on a new and improved rebuild of wallabag.</p>
<p>While we're not quite finished integrating all of the features from from wallabag v1, we felt it was time to release our first alpha of wallabag v2 into the wild so we could start to gather some feedback.</p>
<p>This is a big step in wallabag's development and we're all very proud of what we've accomplished so far.</p>

<p>Feel free to visit this house, but take care, paint is perhaps still fresh.<br />
We officially publish <a href="{filename}pages/roadmap.md">our roadmap for wallabag v2</a>, you can have a look on this page to see our TODO list before the first release.</p>
<p>If you want to help us, there are two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can choose for a project on <a href="{filename}pages/help-this-project.md">our Development page</a> and contribute to it, depending on your skills.</li>
<li>you can also <a href="https://www.wallabag.org/pages/donations.html">make a donation</a>. And because we want transparency, we'll <a href="https://www.wallabag.org/pages/donations-archives.html">publish monthly your donations</a>.  </li>

                <h2><a href="https://www.wallabag.org/blog/2015/08/10/a word about our browser extensions">A word about our browser extensions</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>It's been a week since <a href="https://www.wallabag.org/blog/2015/08/03/wallabag-v1.9.1-released">we've released v1.9.1</a> and it seems there's no major bug coming out. That's great, because it leave us time to work on v2. We'll show you how much we've progressed later, I just wanted to say a word about our browser extensions.</p>
<h2>Chrome Extension</h2>
<p>The chrome extension has been updated with the right click-menu function named <em>Add page to wallabag</em>, as you can see on the picture below.
<img alt="Chrome Extension" src="/images/chrome_ext.png" /></p>
<p>This update has been pushed three days ago on the Chrome Web Store, so you should have got it by now.</p>
<h2>Opera Extension</h2>
<p>Although Opera is having a <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2968277/web-browsers/opera-browser-maker-up-for-sale.html">hard time right now</a>, we don't forget users who use this browser. So we added <a href="http://doc.wallabag.org/en/User/save_your_first_article.html#opera">a documentation chapter</a> in order for users to install it, while the extension is currently submitted and is awaiting validation. It's far from perfect (the right-click menu item opens a new window), but hey it's here.
We'll update this post to share with you the URL of the Opera Extension Repository when we'll get it.</p>
<h2>Firefox Social API</h2>
<p>Some of you may have missed it, but since Firefox 38.0.5, Pocket is integrated by default in Mozilla's browser. We were quite sad about this integration which surprised us. So <a href="http://www.cdetc.fr/reponse-mozilla">we wrote to Mozilla and they said</a> they were working on something so that other read-it-later services can be included. We'll see about that. And we're eager to work with you, red panda !</p>
<p>Apart from this, we've launched with wallabag 1.9.1 the wallabag Firefox Service (go into Config to discover it - https needed). It's quite basic, but it will be much more elaborated with wallabag v2 and it's API, just like all extensions and mobile apps.</p>
<h2>wallabag v2</h2>
<p>Now for the big stuff. It comes. There have been quite some work, but the most important thing right now is the arrival of a new theme in material style logically called <em>material</em>. This theme should be the main one on v2. We all can thank Alexandr Danilov for his work.</p>
<p>Here's a preview below :
<img alt="list of articles" src="/images/material1.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="article view" src="/images/material2.png" /></p>
<p>The best news is that you can test it yourself at <a href="v2.wallabag.org">v2.wallabag.org</a>. Just keep in mind that it's in alpha state, and many features are missing. But it's just a matter of time.</p>
<p>We'll keep you updated when a real alpha is available for you to test in the upcoming weeks, and remember you can help our project. I remind you <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/1254">our main issue</a> explaining on how you can help. </p>
<p>See you soon,</p>

                <h2><a href="https://www.wallabag.org/blog/2015/08/03/wallabag-v1.9.1-released">wallabag v1.9.1 released, last version before v2!</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>We are happy to announce you the release of wallabag v1.9.1. Unlike what it seems, it's quite an important version (it's just between 1.9 and 2.0). A whole number of bugs have been corrected, some translations added, many config websites files added, and there's also a handful of new features we hope you'll like.</p>
<h2>Download</h2>
<p>wallabag 1.9.1 is <a href="https://www.wallabag.org/pages/download-wallabag.html">available on our website</a>.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Buttons to go to next and previous article when you view an article.</li>
<li>Button to mark article as read and go to next unread article.</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts. Lots of them. And vim-style navigation (see below).</li>
<li>Gestures on touch screens. Swipe to left or right to navigate to next or previous articles.</li>
<li>Toolbar also at the bottom of the article with baggy theme, you don't have to scroll back any more when finished !</li>
<li>While you tag an article, you now see all the existing tags. Just click on them to add it to this article. And the more used are shown bigger.</li>
<li>Mozilla Sharing Service ! You will need https to activate it, but it's worth the try, you can get rid of the old extension and use the build-in sharing from Firefox.</li>
<li>Import <em>Netscape-formated-bookmarks</em>. This allows import of Firefox, Internet Explorer (I know, right !), Chrome browsers bookmarks. And certainly many other tools and applications.</li>
<li>If you're using a reverse proxy, you might interested by the BASE_URL constant.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Shortcuts</h3>
<h4>Article view</h4>
<ul>
<li>Navigate between articles: arrows or vim style (<code>h</code> for left, <code>l</code> for right)</li>
<li><code>d</code> or <code>del</code> to delete article</li>
<li><code>f</code> to toggle favorite status</li>
<li><code>m</code> to toggle mark as read status</li>
<li><code>n</code> to mark as read and redirect to the next article</li>
</ul>
<h4>Unread / Favorite / Archive view</h4>
<ul>
<li>with arrows, you can navigate into articles (vim style is also available with <code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, <code>l</code>) and press Enter to read the article!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Session issues</h2>
<p>It's no secret that we've had kind of a hard deal to fix sessions issues. You always ended up disconnected after a while. The thing is, just a little configuration should get rid of this issues. <a href="http://doc.wallabag.org/en/Administrator/sessions.html">Checkout the documentation there</a>.</p>
<p>This bug is already fixed on Framabag.org.</p>
<h2>Application for Firefox OS</h2>
<p>We <strong>now</strong> have our Firefox OS application! Thank you so much <a href="https://github.com/freddyb">@freddyb</a> !</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag-fxos">Download this app here.</a></p>
<h2>wallabag v2</h2>
<p>This is the end of wallabag <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0GFRcFm-aY">as we know it</a>. ~~We launch our premium version~~ We get rid of the old code. We've rebuild wallabag using Symfony2 and it's now much better to work efficiently with clean code.</p>
<p>We will release a first alpha release of wallabag 2.0 in september 2015. You can follow latest news on <a href="https://twitter.com/wallabagapp">twitter</a>, <a href="https://gitter.im/wallabag/wallabag#initial">gitter</a> or <a href="https://framasphere.org/u/wallabag">diaspora*</a>.</p>
