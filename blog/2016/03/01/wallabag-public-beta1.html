        <meta name="description" content="Last week, we published our roadmap for this year: wallabag v2.0.0-beta.1 on 1st March wallabag v2.0.0 on 3rd April wallabag v2.1.0 on 3rd July wallabag v2.2.0 on 3rd October And do you know what? We are on 1st March. So, it&#39;s the beta day! wallabag v2.0.0-beta.1 If you missed our recent blog posts, here are the main features of wallabag v2: a REST API (you can have a look to the documentation) authorization via oAuth2 a new default theme, called material save an article, read it, favorite it, archive it. (Hopefully) annotations: In each article you read, you can write annotations. (read the doc) assign tags to entries edit article titles RSS feeds (with ability to limit number of articles) create a new account from the config page filter entries by reading time, domain name, creation date, status, etc. recover passwords from login page (you have to fill your email on config page) picture preview, if available, is displayed for each entry Public registration migration from wallabag v1/v2 (based on JSON export) (read the doc) migration from Pocket (it works, but we need to implement asynchronous import: if you have too many articles, it can fail) (read the doc) exports in many formats (PDF, JSON, EPUB, MOBI, XML, CSV and TXT). 2-Factor authentication via email (read the doc) Tagging rule: create a rule to automatically assign tags to entries! (read the doc) German, French, Turkish, Persian, Romanian, Polish, Danish and English translations Added Quickstart for beginners (when you don&#39;t have any entries) maintenance mode (useful when you&#39;ll upgrade your wallabag platform) Internal settings for administrator (the account created during installation). We need to documentate this part of wallabag. We have work to do on our API, you can have a look on this pull request. What&#39;s new since last alpha? The big feature is the annotations. Thank you Thomas! We worked on installation: it&#39;s now easier (we removed many parameters to configure during this step) and we check more requirements to facilitate this installation Internal settings for administrator Maintenance mode Turkish, Persian, Romanian, Polish, and Danish translations (thank you to translators) Piwik integration We didn&#39;t write database migrations for this first beta, but this feature is planned for next versions. If you want to upgrade your previous installation, please run this command bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force. You can see the full changelog here: https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/compare/2.0.0-alpha.2...2.0.0-beta.1. Documentation v2 documentation is already available (we still need to write some chapters), you can read it here: http://doc.wallabag.org Our documentation is now hosted on ReadTheDocs.

Third-party applications Our applications (Firefox / Chrome addons and Android / iOS / Windows Phone) are not available for wallabag v2 but we&#39;ll work on them to change that. Test wallabag Keep in mind it&#39;s a beta branch, don&#39;t use it in production. On a dedicated web server If you don&#39;t have it yet, please install composer. Then you can install wallabag by executing the following commands: SYMFONY_ENV=prod composer create-project wallabag/wallabag wallabag &#34;2.0.0-beta.1&#34; --no-dev php bin/console wallabag:install --env=prod php bin/console server:run --env=prod On a shared hosting We provide you a package, wallabag-2.0.0-beta.1.tar.gz, with all dependancies inside. The default configuration uses SQLite for the database. If you want to change these settings, please edit app/config/parameters.yml. Warning: With this package, wallabag don&#39;t check mandatory extensions used in the application (theses checks are made during composer create-project when you have a dedicated web server, see above). Please read our installation documentation to see requirements. Download this file here: http://wllbg.org/latest-v2-package Extract it (tar xvf wallabag-2.0.0-beta.1.tar.gz) In your wallabag folder, run php bin/console wallabag:install --env=prod Run php bin/console server:run --env=prod On our demo platform We published this version on http://v2.wallabag.org but please remind it&#39;s just a demo platform and we can drop database at any time. You can create a free account on this platform. Need help? We are on Gitter (a chat platform), ping us! You can also open a new issue on GitHub. How can you help us? Test, test and test! Install wallabag v2 (see above On a dedicated web server chapter) and tell us if you have any problems. Don&#39;t forget that you can also support us via Paypal, Flattr, Gratipay or Bountysource.

                <p>Last week, <a href="{filename}/20160220-roadmap-wallabag-v2.md">we published our roadmap</a> for this year:</p>

<p>And do you know what? <strong>We are on 1st March</strong>. So, it's the <strong>beta day</strong>!</p>
<h2>wallabag v2.0.0-beta.1</h2>
<p>If you missed our recent blog posts, here are the main features of wallabag v2:</p>
<ul>
<li>a REST API (<a href="http://v2.wallabag.org/api/doc">you can have a look to the documentation</a>)</li>
<li>authorization via oAuth2</li>
<li>a new default theme, called <code>material</code></li>
<li>save an article, read it, favorite it, archive it. (Hopefully)</li>
<li>annotations: In each article you read, you can write annotations. (<a href="http://doc.wallabag.org/en/v2/user/annotations.html">read the doc</a>)</li>
<li>assign tags to entries</li>
<li>edit article titles</li>
<li>RSS feeds (with ability to limit number of articles)</li>
<li>create a new account from the config page</li>
<li>filter entries by reading time, domain name, creation date, status, etc.</li>
<li>recover passwords from login page (you have to fill your email on config page)</li>
<li>picture preview, if available, is displayed for each entry</li>
<li>Public registration</li>
<li>migration from wallabag v1/v2 (based on JSON export) (<a href="http://doc.wallabag.org/en/v2/user/import.html">read the doc</a>)</li>
<li>migration from Pocket (it works, but we need to implement asynchronous import: if you have too many articles, it can fail) (<a href="http://doc.wallabag.org/en/v2/user/import.html">read the doc</a>)</li>
<li>exports in many formats (PDF, JSON, EPUB, MOBI, XML, CSV and TXT).</li>

<li>Added Quickstart for beginners (when you don't have any entries)</li>
<li>maintenance mode (useful when you'll upgrade your wallabag platform)</li>
<li>Internal settings for administrator (the account created during installation). We need to documentate this part of wallabag.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have work to do on our API, <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/pull/1675">you can have a look on this pull request</a>.</p>
<h3>What's new since last alpha?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The big feature is the annotations. <a href="https://github.com/tcitworld">Thank you Thomas</a>!</li>
<li>We worked on installation: it's now easier (we removed many parameters to configure during this step) and we check more requirements to facilitate this installation</li>
<li>Internal settings for administrator</li>
<li>Maintenance mode</li>
<li>Turkish, Persian, Romanian, Polish, and Danish translations (thank you to translators)</li>
<li>Piwik integration</li>
</ul>
<p>We didn't write database migrations for this first beta, but this feature is planned for next versions.<br />
If you want to upgrade your previous installation, please run this command <code>bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force</code>.</p>
