                <h2>wallabag v2.0.0-beta.2</h2>
<p>If you missed our recent blog posts, here are the main features of wallabag v2:</p>
<ul>
<li>a REST API (<a href="http://v2.wallabag.org/api/doc">you can have a look to the documentation</a>)</li>
<li>authorization via oAuth2</li>
<li>a new default theme, called <code>material</code></li>
<li>save an article, read it, favorite it, archive it. (Hopefully)</li>
<li>annotations: In each article you read, you can write annotations. (<a href="http://doc.wallabag.org/en/v2/user/annotations.html">read the doc</a>)</li>
<li>assign tags to entries</li>
<li>edit article titles</li>
<li>RSS feeds (with ability to limit number of articles)</li>
<li>create a new account from the config page</li>
<li>filter entries by reading time, domain name, creation date, status, etc.</li>
<li>recover passwords from login page (you have to fill your email on config page)</li>
<li>picture preview, if available, is displayed for each entry</li>
<li>Public registration</li>
<li>migration from wallabag v1/v2 (based on JSON export) (<a href="http://doc.wallabag.org/en/v2/user/import.html">read the doc</a>)</li>
<li>migration from Pocket (it works, but we need to implement asynchronous import: if you have too many articles, it can fail) (<a href="http://doc.wallabag.org/en/v2/user/import.html">read the doc</a>)</li>
<li>exports in many formats (PDF, JSON, EPUB, MOBI, XML, CSV and TXT).</li>
<li>2-Factor authentication via email (<a href="http://doc.wallabag.org/en/v2/user/configuration.html#two-factor-authentication">read the doc</a>)</li>
<li>Tagging rule: create a rule to automatically assign tags to entries! (<a href="http://doc.wallabag.org/en/v2/user/configuration.html#tagging-rules">read the doc</a>)</li>
<li>German, French, Turkish, Persian, Romanian, Polish, Danish, Spanish and English translations</li>
<li>Added Quickstart for beginners (when you don't have any entries)</li>
<li>maintenance mode (useful when you'll upgrade your wallabag platform)</li>
<li>Internal settings for administrator (the account created during installation). We need to documentate this part of wallabag.</li>
<li>For 3rd apps developers, a developer page is available to create API token</li>
</ul>
<p>We have work to do on our API, <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/pull/1675">you can have a look on this pull request</a>.</p>
<h3>What's new since last beta?</h3>
<ul>
<li>change the way to install wallabag via composer (<code>composer install</code> instead of <code>composer create-project</code> to make updates easier)</li>
<li>API: For 3rd apps developers, we added a developer page to create API token</li>
<li>API: added more properties (starred and archived) on entries (<a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/1634">#1634</a>)</li>
<li>API: you can now have the wallabag version via the <code>/api/version</code> endpoint</li>
<li>when you import articles from 3rd services (like Pocket), you can mark all the entries as read</li>
<li>We added <code>wallabag</code> in our page title, to avoid confusion via the original article <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/1756">#1756</a></li>
<li>Fixed Docker timezone <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/1726">#1726</a></li>
<li>spanish translation</li>
<li>documentation about filters <a href="http://doc.wallabag.org/en/v2/user/filters.html">http://doc.wallabag.org/en/v2/user/filters.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We didn't write database migrations for this beta, but this feature is planned for next versions.<br />
If you want to upgrade your previous installation, please run this command <code>bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force</code>.</p>
