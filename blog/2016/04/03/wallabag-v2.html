        <meta name="description" content="Some history, some thanks Three years ago, I started a little script, to replace the closed service I used to use (french article). It was a personal script, that I hosted on GitHub. I never realized that people could be interested with it. You are more than 8.900 users on Framabag, you are more than 1.800 fans on GitHub, wallabag 1.x was downloaded more than 33.400 times, we released so many versions with so many features, and our history can still go on. To all of our users: Merci. If our project is still alive today, it&#39;s also thanks to Thomas Citharel (@tcitworld). When I was not available for the project, he was always here to fix bugs or to reply to your questions. Merci Thomas! wallabag v2 is in my head for more than 2 years. But this version that we release today is also here thanks to Jérémy Benoist (@j0k)): without his help on many technical subjects, wallabag v2 wouldn&#39;t exist. Merci Jérémy! Managing such a project like wallabag is so exciting (but it&#39;s also very tiring). Today, it&#39;s a big part of my personal life, that&#39;s why I also want to thank my wife, because it&#39;s not easy every day to share your life with a wallaby. Merci Audrey!
