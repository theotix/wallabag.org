## Some history, some thanks

[Three years ago, I started a little script, to replace the closed service I used to use](http://loeuillet.org/poche-pour-remplacer-instapaper-pocket-et-readability). It was a personal script, that I hosted on GitHub. I never realized that you could be interested with it.

[You are more than 8.900 users on Framabag](https://framabag.org/analytics/), [you are more than 1.800 lovers on GitHub](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/stargazers), wallabag 1.x was downloaded more than 33.400 times, [we released so many versions](https://www.wallabag.org/pages/releases.html) with so many features, and our history can be still so long.

To all of our users: **Merci**.

If our project is still alive today, it's also thanks to Thomas Citharel ([@tcitworld](https://twitter.com/tcitworld)). When I was not available for the project, he was always here to fix bugs or to reply to your questions. **Merci Thomas**!

wallabag v2 is in my head for more than 2 years. But this version that we release today is also here thanks to Jérémy Benoist (@j0k): without his help on many technical subjects, wallabag v2 wouldn't exist. **Merci Jérémy**!

Managing such a project like wallabag is so exciting (but it's also very tiring). Today, it's a big part of my personal life, that's why I also want to thank my wife, because it's not easy every day to share life with a wallaby. **Merci Audrey**!

Stop the bla bla!

## wallabag 2.0.0 is here
