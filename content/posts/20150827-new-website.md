title: New house to prepare a great release
tags: website

2015 will be a great year for wallabag, because we worked very hard and we'll release a first alpha of wallabag v2.

To welcome this new version, we wanted a new house.

**Welcome in our new house!**

Feel free to visit this house, but take care, paint is perhaps still fresh.  
We officially publish [our roadmap for wallabag v2]({filename}pages/roadmap.md), you can have a look on this page to see our TODO list before the first release.

If you want to help us, there are two ways:

* you can choose for a project on [our Development page]({filename}pages/help-this-project.md) and contribute to it, depending on your skills.
* you can also [make a donation]({filename}/pages/donations.md). And because we want transparency, we'll [publish monthly your donations]({filename}/pages/donations-archive.md).  

Now, we can put all our efforts on the latest features to implement for wallabag v2. Stay tuned!
